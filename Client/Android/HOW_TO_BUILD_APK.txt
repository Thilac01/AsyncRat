HOW TO BUILD APK FOR ANDROID

To turn this Python script (main.py) into an Android APK, you need to use "Buildozer".
This process works best on Linux (Ubuntu) or Google Colab. Windows users are recommended to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

STEPS:

1. Install Buildozer (on Linux/WSL):
   pip install buildozer cython

2. Initialize Buildozer in this directory:
   buildozer init

3. Edit 'buildozer.spec' that was created:
   - Change 'title' to your app name.
   - In 'requirements', add:
     requirements = python3,kivy,opencv,numpy

   - For Camera permissions, find 'android.permissions' and set:
     android.permissions = CAMERA,INTERNET

4. Build the APK:
   buildozer android debug

5. Once finished, the APK will be in the 'bin/' folder.
   Transfer it to your phone and install.

NOTE:
- The 'opencv' requirement makes the APK large ~100MB usually.
- Ensure your Android device is on the same network or can reach the IP '170.64.186.179'.
